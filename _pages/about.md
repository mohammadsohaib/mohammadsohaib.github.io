Welcome!

I am an aspiring neuroscientist looking to understand how the brain 
computes. I earned my master's degree in medicine from Technion, Haifa. My
thesis work was about plasticity mechanisms in pyramidal neurons. This work was strongly rooted in
neurophysiologyâ€” an essential chunk of knowledge needed to understand
the computation of the neurons.

Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering
from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.

Presently, I am looking for doctoral research roles in System Neurosciences.
