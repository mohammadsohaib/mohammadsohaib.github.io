# About Me

I am a doctoral research candidate investigating early-stage AD under the guidance of [Adrian Wanner](https://www.psi.ch/en/lnb/people/adrian-andreas-wanner) at PSI Villigen co-supervised by [Mehmet Fatih Yanik](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/faculty/professors/person-detail.MjAzNTMz.TGlzdC80MTEsMTA1ODA0MjU5.html) at ETH Zurich. My research focuses on:

- Working Memory deficit in prodromal AD.
- Dynamical connectomics approach to explore structure-function relationships in neuronal networks.

## Academic Background

**MSc Medicine** | Technion, Haifa (2022)  
My master's thesis investigated plasticity mechanisms in pyramidal neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, pharmacological approaches, and optogenetic methods.

**Electrical Engineering** | Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi (2018)  
My undergraduate education provided the fundamental technical skills that support my current neuroengineering research. As reflected in Jamia Tarana: 'Yahin se lala-e-sehra ko ye suraagh mila, Ke dil ke daagh ko kis tarha rakhte hein roshan.' It is here that the wild tulip learnt, how to make the scar of heart aglow.

## Technical Expertise
- Electrophysiological techniques (patch-clamp)
- In-vivo two-photon calcium imaging
- Neuronal analysis
- Data science and machine learning for neurological applications
- Cross-disciplinary project management

## Industry Applications

My research at the intersection of neuroscience and engineering has potential applications in:

- **Neurotherapeutics Development**: Novel approaches for treating cognitive disorders and memory deficits
- **Biomedical Technology**: Advanced imaging and neural interface innovations
- **Digital Health**: Computational tools for early detection of neurodegenerative conditions
- **Consulting**: Expert analysis on neurotechnology trends and neurological health innovations

## Connect
