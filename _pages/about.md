Welcome amigo!

I am an aspiring neuroscientist looking to understand how the brain 
computes( if it does). I earned my master's degree in medicine from Technion, Haifa.
My thesis work is about plasticity in pyramidal neurons. This work is strongly rooted in
neurophysiologyâ€” an essential chunk of knowledge needed to understand
the computation of the neurons. 
Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering
from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.

Presently, I am looking doctoral research roles in System Neurosciences.
