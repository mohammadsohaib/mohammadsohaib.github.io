Hello and welcome! I am a doctoral research candidate passionate about understanding the computational capabilities of the brain. 
I am fortunate to be working with <a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/lnb/people/adrian-andreas-wanner">Adrian Wanner</a> at PSI Villigen and 
<a href="https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/faculty/professors/person-detail.MjAzNTMz.TGlzdC80MTEsMTA1ODA0MjU5.html">Mehmet Fatih Yanik</a> at ETH Zurich. My research is centered on X-ray mediated optogenetics for minimally invasive optogenetic stimulation, and dynamical connectomics to explore the structure-function relationship of neurons in both health and disease.

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I earned my master’s degree in medicine from Technion, Haifa. My thesis delved into the plasticity mechanisms in pyramidal neurons. We leveraged in-vitro whole-cell patch-clamp technique, pharmacology, and optogenetics to uncover a novel, low-frequency plasticity mechanism in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons.

My academic journey began with a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi in 2018. My time at Jamia was transformative, best encapsulated by a couplet from Jamia Tarana — 'Yahin se lala-e-sehra ko ye suraagh mila, Ke dil ke daagh ko kis tarha rakhte hein roshan.' This translates to 'It is here that the wild tulip learnt, How to make the scar of heart aglow.'

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a potential collaborator, or someone interested in the intersection of neuroscience and engineering, I'd love to connect and explore how we can illuminate the mysteries of the brain together.
