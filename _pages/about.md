Welcome!

I am an aspiring neuroscientist looking to understand how the brain 
computes. I am a doctoral research candidate with <a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/lnb/people/adrian-andreas-wanner">Adrian Wanner</a>  
at PSI Villigen, & <a href="https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/faculty/professors/person-detail.MjAzNTMz.TGlzdC80MTEsMTA1ODA0MjU5.html">Mehmet Fatih Yanik</a> at ETH Zurich . 
I am working on X-ray mediated optogenetics for minimally invasive optogenetic stimulation,
and dynamical connectomics to understand structure-function 
relationship of neurons in health and disease.

Prior to this, I earned my master's degree in medicine from Technion, Haifa. My
thesis work was about plasticity mechanisms in pyramidal neurons. We extensively
used in-vitro whole-cell patch-clamp technique in combination with pharmacology
and optogenetics to identify a novel, low frequency plasticity mechanism in the apical
dendrites of pyramidal neurons.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering
from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi in 2018. My learning at Jamia could
be well summarised with a couplet from Jamia Tarana â€” <i>Yahin se lala-e-sehra ko ye suraagh mila,
Ke dil ke daagh ko kis tarha rakhte hein roshan:</i> <i>It is here that the wild tulip learnt,
How to make the scar of heart aglow.</i>
