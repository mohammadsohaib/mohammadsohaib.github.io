<em>&quot; The isolated knowledge obtained by a group
of specialists in a narrow field has in itself no 
value whatsoever, but only in its synthesis with 
all the rest of knowledge and only in as much as 
it really contributes towards answering the 
demand, 'who are we?' - Erwin Schrodinger
&quot;<em>

What Schrodinger said in the above quote is at the heart of my research philosophy.
As an esteemed member of probably the most complex and selfish specie in the known universe,
I am naturally inclined to understand the nature of my ownself; curious
about my own consciousness.
This curiosity made me passionate about neural sciences, philosophy, psychology.

Academically speaking, my research interests revolve around 
intelligence and how information is represented in the brain.
I have chosen system neurosciences (or rather it has chosen me) 
for the perusal of this ambitious endeavour.

Following topics instantly grab my attention:
- Plasticity in Neural Circuits
- Dendritic Computations
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Psychiatric Disorders
