Erwin Schrodinger once said, 'The isolated knowledge obtained by a group of specialists in a narrow field has no value in itself; it acquires value only when synthesized with all other knowledge, and only inasmuch as it contributes to answering the question, 'who are we?' This belief forms the core of my research philosophy.

As a member of a species renowned for its complexity and introspective nature, I find myself compelled to understand the essence of my own being and the mysteries of consciousness. This innate curiosity has led me to a profound interest in the fields of neural sciences, philosophy, and psychology.

From an academic perspective, my research is centered around the exploration of intelligence and the mechanisms of information representation within the brain. I have found my calling in systems neuroscience—a field that has chosen me as much as I have chosen it—in a bid to pursue this ambitious quest.

In the course of my doctoral studies, I am delving into the intricacies of Alzheimer's disease, with a specific focus on the retrosplenial cortex. My research explores both the functional and structural aspects of this area of the brain. Utilizing 2-photon microscopy for optical readout and electron microscopy for structural imaging, I am aiming to unravel why working memory is specifically impaired during the prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease. This focus forms a significant portion of my thesis."

The following areas of study also particularly pique my interest:
  * Neural Circuit Plasticity 
  * Computations in Dendrites 
  * Psychiatric Disorders and Their Neurological Underpinnings
  * The Applications and Implications of Artificial Neural Networks
