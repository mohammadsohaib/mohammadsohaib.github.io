<em>&quot; The isolated knowledge obtained by a group
of specialists in a narrow field has in itself no 
value whatsoever, but only in its synthesis with 
all the rest of knowledge and only in as much as 
it really contributes towards answering the 
demand, 'who are we?' - Erwin Schrodinger
&quot;<em>

I have always been curious about myself and my own consciousness.
This naturally inclined me to neural sciences, philosophy, psychology.
What Schrodinger said in the above quote is at the heart of my research philosophy.

The ultimate aim of my research is to understand myself 
better — Who am I. Why I do what I do.
Academically speaking, my research interests revolve around 
intelligence and how information is represented in the brain.
I have chosen system neurosciences (or rather it has chosen me) 
for the perusal of this ambitious endeavour.

Following topics instantly grab my attention:
- Plasticity in Neural Circuits.
- Dendritic Computations
- Artifical Neural Networks
* coming soon
